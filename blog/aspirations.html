  <h1>Blogging Aspirations</h1>
  <p>I have a few unrealistic goals for my writing based on past failures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To express ideas with nuance</li>
    <li>To avoid being (too) pretentious</li>
    <li>To write for others rather than for myself</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We're nowhere close, but maybe this blog will be fun regardless.</p>
