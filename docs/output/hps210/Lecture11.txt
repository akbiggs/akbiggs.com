Lecture 11
Review
==================

The driving question behind the course is: What is science?
Alternatively, what should we cover in a survey of the history of science?

There's no concrete answer.
Some people argue that there is a large divide between technology and science.
The teacher argues that in reality, technology and science are very closely
intertwined. The development of science is the development of technology. Some
people argue that there is no difference between science and technology. Teacher
doesn't want to go that extreme.

The Origins of Math and Writing
===============================

We went from markings on stones, to protowriting, to full-blown symbology on the
oracle bone.

Gutenberg (1395 - 1468)
======================

Creating a printing press changed everything. Didn't just double or triple the
amount of books in Europe, increased it radically.

A few big innovations follow in the heels of the printing press, including
Martin Luthur with the Revolution, Vesalius disagrees with Galen and says that
we need to look more closely at the corpses being dissected, to have actual
operations that examine the bodies of dead people. This happened in 1543
(important year, remember this).

Kepler
==========

Three laws. Memorize them.

Tycho Brahe
=============

Important dude too.

Galileo
==========

Discussed early work on the military compass, produced a better telescope,
defense of Copernicism in light of the church saying that you couldn't say that
Copernicus was true.

Leyden Jar (!!!!)
=================

Used to store electricity. Definitely going to be on the exam.

Exam is Thursday 26th of June, 7 - 9 pm, room 3202 in Sandford Fleming
