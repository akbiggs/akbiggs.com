Medieval European Science
=========================

There was no total lack of learning during the middle ages, unlike what the
standard story advocates.

Pope Sylvester II (946 - 1003)
=================

Went to learn astronomy and other sciences from other cultures, slandered as a
dark magician.

Had a standard education:
    trivium: grammar, logic, rhetoric
    quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy

What people would have learned at this point had a few holes in it, wasn't very
accessible and interesting. Sylvester focused on writing books that fixed these
problems and reintroduced the Arabic numeric system and the Abacus into standard
education.

At this point, people don't switch to Arabic numerals, but stick with Roman
numerals.

The Armillary Sphere
=================

An astronomical tool that allows people to figure out where the north star is
relative to where they are. Use this to understand where stars are in the night
sky, used for both education and discovery.

Fibonacci (1170 - 1250 CE)
=================

Credited for spreading the Arabic numeral system somehow, despite what Sylvester
did.

Wrote Liber Abaci, a compilation of his learning from being brought into Arab
land by way of his father being a traitor. Showed people how to calculate
money-related things, which spreads rapidly due to its importance to people.

So there are three things that are spreading now across Europe: Abacus,
Armillary Sphere, and Arabic Numeral System.

Frederick II (1194 - 1250 CE)
==================

Fibonacci met with him, and they shared similar views on the values of Islamic
learning. Met al-Kamil, the Ayyubid sultan, and convinced him as part of a
crusade to give up the holy land, Bethleham and others, by way of talking as
opposed to slaughtering, which is not how crusades were supposed to be
conducted.

University of Naples (est. 1224)
====================

All the education buildings running across Europe are church-run: Frederick II
decides to change this and starts up the University of Naples. We see a nice
network of knowledge beginning to form as scholars are given a special privlege
in society. Plato isn't a great leader for scientific discussion due to his
focus on all senses being useless and rationality being the main thing, so
Aristotle's viewpoint is emphasized.

Medieval European Alchemy
==========================

We see traces of this through gold coins issued by Edward III (1312 - 1377).
Edward thought it would be useful to recruit alchemists into his kingdom, as
they had practical skills to produce more coins from limited resources. This
made alchemy become much more popular, but also made the church ban alchemy
outright because they believed it was forgery.

People believe that they can create materials from other materials by way of
combining the four elements theory with the idea that everything is made from
mercury and sulfur. Furthermore, since they believe that everything is trying to
become its own kind, they think all metal is slowly turning into gold, since
gold isn't corruptable(doesn't tarnish, doesn't dissolve (except in aqua
regia)).

They have a lot of interesting physical theories, but they're all written in an
extremely weird, symbolic way (e.g. green lion eating golden sun representing
the fact that gold doesn't dissolve).

Practical Alchemy
================

Didn't make it into the official university curriculum at this point. Separation
between manual arts and higher studies (lower class vs. higher class).

The main goal of practical alchemy is achieving immortality by creating the
Philosopher's Stone. They don't achieve that, but they do create a bunch of
interesting medicines.

Medieval European Medicine
========================

Connects the theoretical side of things with the practical alchemy side of
things at different levels of the hierarchy.

Learn'ed Medicine
================

The level of the hierarchy where people learned the trivium, quadrivium. If you
went into medicine, you learned about Galen's four humours theory and learned
about astronomy, the signs that allowed you to diagnose different conditions
based on their correlations to the four humours.

Taking the Pulse and Qiemo
-----------------------

Interesting similarities between the Greek/Helenic tradition of taking the pulse
and the Chinese method (called Qiemo). Taking the pulse is the biggest
diagnostic tool: doctors take the pulse, think hard and then say what's wrong.

In Qiemo, there are three types of pulses:
  cun: floating small intenstine, sunken heart
  guan: floating gall bladder, sunken liver
  chi: floating bladder, sunken kidneys

By taking each of them more info is gathered.

In Greek/Helenic, four phases marked by two stages:
  systole: pulse going out
  diastole: pulse going in

Four phases are created by before and after phases for both stages.

Treatment: The Six Non-Naturals
===========================

How the doctor gives treatment to patients, what they observe for diagnostics.

1. Ambient air
2. Food and drink
3. Exercise and rest
4. Sleep and wakefulness
5. Excretion and retention (a particular concern)
6. The passions of the soul

Phlebotomy
=============

Bleeding was considered super important because it would help to drain the body
of excess humours. Different limbs were bloodlet depending on what was wrong.

However, this was manual labor, and it was messy and gross, so this was not
something that Learn'ed doctors would do. Instead this was passed to the next
people down in the hierarchy.

Note that women didn't need to be bloodlet as often because a good, strong
period would induce it anyways.

Barbers and Surgeons
==================

Didn't require going to university. Anyone could practice to be this.

Mid-Wives
===============

Same level of the hierarchy as the barbers and surgeons. Although doctors are
consulted, women run the baby-making show. This was because women were not only
believed to be better at it, but also because it was forbidden for anyone who
wasn't your husband to be near your vagina.

Ergot
=======

Surprisingly effective herb used in medical remedies despite being slightly
poisonous. Induced birth and stopped bleeding due to being a vaso-restrictor.

Pennyroyal
============

Helped abortions. Caused some herbs to be used to extinction. The church thot
care needed to be taken because beyond a certain age it was considered killing.
This point was determined by the quickening, which was determined by the woman
saying that the quickening had just happened.

Mid-Wives and Witches
==================

Note that mid-wives were not accused as often of being witches as myths might
make it out to seem. Women were certainly accused of being witches and tortured
and killed.
