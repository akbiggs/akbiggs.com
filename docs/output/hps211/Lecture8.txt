Henry Mosley
==============

Physicist who did first experimental work to favor Bohr's theory of the atom
(positive charge located in a densely packed nucleus). Made important
contributions to organizing the periodic table, moved things around and
introduced new elements to fill in the gaps. Researched x-rays.

People reacted to his death with anger.
Rutherford compared it to using the Lutherford (large ship) to carry a butter.
Milikan said it was one of the most hideous and irreperable crimes in history.

Something that we will be discussing is that we shouldn't look at the 
world wars in the sense that it killed scientists, but rather as a movement in
technology. People want science to get involved to create things that can kill
people more effectively and end the war.

Getting Science Involved
==========================

1905 - British Science Guild established
People realize that science can contribute to society, to solving problems in
society. Largely seen as a theoretical practice until now. Pure scientists are
finally being seen as useful.

In 1914, the Editor of Nature magazine calls for scientists to get involved.
People can tell that war is coming and that science will be important.

Sir Philip Magnus says that the scientists in England work independently and are
not close in cooperation, compared to those in Germany.

Managing Science
==================

There's a problem with submarines. German ships are sinking them, destroying
supply chains and disrupting the economy massively. Britain creates the Royal Navy's
Board of Invention and Research to solve it.

Uhm. Since they don't have sonar yet, they use trained sealions. They also
create the hydrophone, which lets you listen and figure out when a submarine is
approaching. Difficult to tell where it is. 

Starts development on early forms of sonar, collaborating with France and
particularly America. In the US, new inventions are mostly done by independent
developers. The Naval Consulting Board attempts to gather all the best engineers
together and get them in a room to solve the sonar problem. Excludes pure
scientists because it would make patents more difficult.

The National Research Council does something different. They invite all kinds of
scientists and are interested in independent collaboration. Expands as the war
goes on, and sees success that the Board does not due to their different
approach. By the end of the war, the NRC has pretty much absorbed the NCB.

Chemical Warfare
==================

Similar organization going on in Germany. Fritz Haber positions himself so he
can lead and work with other scientists as head of Kaiser Wilhelm. He is known
as the father of chemical warfare. Early research earns him the Nobel Prize:
uses the Haber-Bosch Process to produce ammonia.

Unfortunately, ammonia is used to produce bullets, bombs. They get a lot of it,
importing it from tons of places.

People are worried about creating poisonous gases because it will make them look
terrible. It's a horrible thing. Haber, however, is enthusiastic, and creates
the chlorine poisonous gas. 22 April, 1915, Haber's gas gets used for the first
time, after an accident kills four soliders and the general sees how potent it
is. He uses it and it blows a four-mile hole in the army. Opportunity is not
pressed.

They start creating anti-poisons. Haber's wife kills herself in protest.

Pop Quiz
===========

The army has an IQ test. It's just bizarre, because it is supposed to test
native intelligence before presuppositions are developed, but the questions
presume class, presume familiarity and presume certain social values. Used to
divide people into positions or reject them outright. There are two types: alpha
and beta. The alpha test is for literate people, whereas the beta test is for
illiterate people.

WW2
==========

After WW1, most scientists return to civilian work. The military administrative
bodies desolve. Academic scientists look down on industry counterparts because
the war has killed a ton of people, and that is difficult to be involved with.

Before the War
===============

Nazi Germany, before the war, is pouring a ton of money into rocket technology.
They create the V1 and V2. The V1 is more like an airplane, while the V2 is a
proper rocket.

Sonar is finished between the two wars. Allows detection of submarines but can't
avoid getiting shot by it, so radar is created to detect position.

Manhatten Project
===================

Brings together many different groups systematically to create the atomic bomb.
Establishes national laboratories across the United States. They spend 2 billion
dollars(26 billion today), employing 130k people. 90% of the money is spent on
the materials necessary to create the bomb. Requires huge factories.

Dropping the bomb had a serious effect on scientists. Movements to find peace.
The sentiment that science should be used to find peace and not be used to
develop more lethal weapons largely originates from this moment. Should science
be regulated?

Post-WW2
==============

Science, Government and Industry stay aligned. Gvnmt funds scientists, and some
groups begin rejecting government money while others play up the military
aspects of their research to earn more.

There's a ratcheting effect of war.

Theme
========

Science becomes a very large, organized entity. The beginning of what is called
"Big Science". There's a unification of scientific, industrial and government
interests. Learn that they can be mutually beneficial to each other.

Blog Post Advice
================

Avoid big ideas in passing.
Appreciate who your audience is. Make sure that they have enough knowledge to
follow your argument.
Only bring up sources because of facts and positions. Make sure they are
relevant to the discussion.
