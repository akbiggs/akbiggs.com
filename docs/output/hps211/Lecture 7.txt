Lecture 6
Polar Exploration
=====================

We're interested in starting in the 19th century, with James Clark Ross' "discovery"
of Antarctica. Starts off the age of heroes wanting to explore.

Magnetic Crusade
=================

Magnetism was the original cause of sending people down to the South Pole. You navigate
using a compass, which is magnetic. People have a Newtonian-like fa
ith that the world
can be explained laws, and that given enough info about terresterial magnetism, one
can infer what the laws are. They didn't have much data from the South Pole, and there
seemeed to be interesting, unexpected behavior in the South Pole.

The French were perceived to be further ahead in this field compared to Britain, prompting
a rivalry that encouraged Britain to show France up by making a discovery.

People thought that there were more than two poles.

James Clarke Ross
====================

Previously went to the North Pole.
1839 - 4 year voyage abord HMS Terror and Erebus. Antarctica, 1 year previously, is likely
found to be a continent and not merely ice.

Little is known about the continent, particularly its interior. No one knows what it looks like,
what's there, or what geographical features it has.

Ross sailed from New Zealand to Antarctica, which hadn't been done before due to a giant ice
pack in the way. He discovered something very disappointing: land. He thought he could just sail
to the magnetic center, but instead there was all this land in his way.

So Ross was disappointed, but he made many discoveries:
  -- Ross Ice Shelf
  -- Victoria Land
  -- Active Volcano
  -- Large mountain range

Continued to make magnetic observation while he was there.

HMS Challenger 
==================

Still trying to map terrestrial magnestism. Ship is designed for scientific research. In the
time that went by, catalogued almost 4000 previously unknown species	. Located what we now know
as Mariana's Trench.

The Heroic Age of Exploration
================================

They're making large-scale observations. But as a result as we approach the end of the 19th century,
we still have no understanding of how magnetism works.

People are really interested in Antarctica by the end of the 19th century 
because of fossils (Darwin), uniformitarionism (Lyell), and people have a new-found fascination
with glaciers because of ice ages. People really wanna know how glaciers move around and
what they could contain.

Now people are interested in taking risks, facing danger head-on. People see fear differently
and take on challenges as an important part of demonstrating that they are the fittest.

People wanna be heroes. THey're celebrities now when they explore.

RRS Discovery 1901-1904
==========================

Last wooden three masted ship built for Britain. RRS (Royal Research Ship) as opposed to
HMS (Her Majesty's Service) designed for antarctic exploration. Led by Robert Falcon Scot,
with Ernest Shackleton third in command.

They studied magnetism, zoology and biology, and became celebrities. They had to in order
to expense the voyage.

Nimrod Expedition 1907-1909
=======================

Magnetism becomes less the reason for exploration. It's more about geography, biology and
social status.

The Nimrod is led by Earnest Shackleton. Finds the magnetic south pole, and establishes a
new record southern latitude.

Makes an attempt at the geographic south pole, but is unsuccessful.

Terra-Nova Expedition 1910-1913
==============================

Race between Ronald Amundsen and Falcon Scott. Amundsen really wants to do this because
he owes people a ton of money, leaves port early.

Largest antarctic scientific expedition to date, with 12 scientists, 40 000 specimens of
2000 species, 400 never identified before. They studied the Emperor Penguins, who were
thought to be the most ancient birds and therefore most related to the dinosaurs.
People want to map the penguins back to dinos using their embryos.

Brings back longest unbroken metrological record (snow, and glacier data) for Antarctica, still
used as baseline for some studies today. Determined the height of the Aurora.

Why would Historians care?
============================

There's a rise of public interest in science surrounding this. People are becoming very
interested in everything, regardless of who they are. The harshest conditions in the globe,
life-threatening conditions make this very exciting for everyone. Everyone's writing
on the mountains that are found.

Technology
=============

The dogs, the sleds, the clothing are all technology here, but particularly the sleds are
interesting. Scott outfitted the sleds with motors that were used to drive the sleds around.
The standard instruments were not useful in Antarctica because of the harsh conditions. Better
technologies are developed to accomodate for this situation.

Scott's technology is inferior in some ways, despite the sleds. More interested in appearing
heroic and gentlemenly, whereas Amundsen has no such concerns, wears furs instead of Scott's
waxed outfits.

The question for historians, as at any point in time, is who are the scientists? Are they the
people who sit around in labs developing theories or the adventurers and workers who put their
lives at risk to make new discoveries? Science begins to change, and what is valued in science
changes.

The answers to these judgements change drastically how you interpret and view science. What you
think is science is heavily based around how you view things, what your values are. The legacies
of Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton could be completely different depending on your views.

  Miasma + Contagionism views

Transmutation Species
  - Darwin
  - Lemark
  - Chambers (published Vestiges anonymous, promotes getting to higher ground from
              middle ground, so appliyng natural selection towards class promotion.
              There's a higher order law that kicks in during the embryo stage that
              promotes its complexity. Primes people to think about Darwin)

Dates: memorize publication of Darwin's pictures
       Time periods
       Rabies vaccine
       1905: special relativity (miracle year, Einstein publishes a bunch of papers
                                 that are very influential)

Concentrate more on people, their concepts and how they argued for them.

20th century physics -> SR/GR
The key experiments that were done:
   -- M+M: speed of light is the same in all frames of referenece, therefore
   no aether.
   -- Eddington: His test of gravity bending light, and how the results were
   dubious. 1905.
   -- Box thought experiment showing gravity is the same as acceleration.
   -- Einstein's Motivation: Generally people believe that M+M was the
   motivation, but another view is that Einstein's motivation was the laws
   of electrodynamics not behaving the same under different circumstances.
   Einstein wanted laws of nature to be uniform.
