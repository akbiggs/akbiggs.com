Pitch
======

Hey, I'm Alex.

- Small businesses selling physical products and services are hot stuff these days
- Really easy to advertise, really easy to handle transactions, pretty easy to
learn new profitable skills
- but surprisingly difficult to get off the ground! this is because of laws.
- municipal, provincial and federal laws place a wide range of restrictions on where
your business can go
- keeping track of all of them is highly difficult, and they're constantly changing
- hiring a lawyer to figure it all out for you is time-consuming and $$$
- what to do?
- my app, Frontier, determines where your business can be built by
analyzing zoning laws that match up to a description of what your business
does
- fully automated and super fast because it leverages IBM Watson
- shows you where to go, hassle-free.
- I want neural-net experts.
