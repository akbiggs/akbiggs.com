CSC454 Meeting 1
==================

When we make our pitch, we will mainly be focusing on isolating the target
audience of the service and establishing that it is a > $1 billion industry.

When isolating who your target audience is, cut down based on the industries
that you are targetting and the people who are part of that industry. The
industries that you target should drastically affect how you tailor the
app.

You don't really target a bunch of different industries though, you learn
to focus on one single demographic that all your industries have in
common. For example, Pintrest focuses on women, primarily older.

The industries of law
------------------------

- insurance
- highway traffic
- judicial system
- criminal
- labour
- corporate
- family law
- parliament / lawmakers
- immigration
- patent
- income tax law
- tort law (kind of like civil law, private law where people sue for damages
that prevent them from operating)

As you identify the people who are affected by your industry, try to
identify the biggest pain points that they have, and write software
that solves those pain points.

From the brainstorming:

1. Need to figure out more specifically who I am targetting with the
zoning regulation application. Too broad atm.
2. Once I have a more specific target audience, much easier to reason
about the revenue that this application could potentially bring.
