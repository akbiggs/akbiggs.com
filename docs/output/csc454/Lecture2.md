CSC454 Lecture 2
==================

Today's lecture is all about team-building.

Having a poor team can ruin a great plan. It affects your workflow
and definitely affects how willing investors are to put money into
your company.

If you have a good team, pitch it early. A good team chemistry
gets investors' attentions early and can make up for weaker points
of your pitch.

Roles
-------

- Leader
- Guru
- Industry veteran
- Sales personality
- Financial mind

When building, it's useful to think in threes: Dev, Design, and Expert.
The Expert of the team doubles not only as a knowledge base, but also
as a potential customer of the software, so the app should be tailored
to them.

When you've developed something that is viable and could make a lot
of money, it's okay as a technical founder to take a backseat and let
someone else with a knack for business scale the company up. As the
money gets larger, you're dealing with more danger, more competitors,
so you've either got to adjust or sell out.

The *tech adoption curve* describes a trend of how the product market changes
at various stages of the products' lifespan. The early
money comes from innovators, then early adopters, and only makes
for approximately 15% of the total revenue. Then there's
an *adoption gap*, where you're trying to penetrate into the
early majority of consumers, which make up more than twice the
amount of the initial stages.

(Aside: Don't get stuck eight months in development with no proven customers
and then ship.)
