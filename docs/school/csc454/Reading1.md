Customer Segments
------------------

The *customer segment* defines the different groups of people or
organizations that the business is targeted towards, that the 
business aims to please.

There are several types of customer segments:

- *Mass market*: Don't distinguish between different customer segments

- *Niche market*: Very specific, specialized customer segments

- *Segmented*: Targets a market segment with different needs and problems.

- *Diversified*: Serves two unrelated customer segments with very different needs
and problems. e.g. Amazon with cloud computing

- *Multi-sided platforms*: serves two or more independent customer segments.

Value Propositions
------------------

Define what the company offers, the bundle of products and services that create
value. Determine why someone chooses a thing over another thing.
