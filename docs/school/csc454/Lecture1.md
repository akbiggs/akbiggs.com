================

When developing a business, you essentially have two steps:

1. Iteration: Customer Discovery and Customer Validation.
Continuously iterate on an idea, identifying the scealeable and
repeatable sales models that you can build on, and turning
hypotheses about what people want into facts.

2. Execution: Create customers. Then build a company.

B2C: Business to Consumer
B2B: Business to Business

The hottest investment sectors today are the internet(27%),
healthcare(27%) and mobile/telecom(14%).

When creating an investable venture, think big. Aim for a field
that is proven to have a large amount of money and interest
(search, social, music). Innovate in that field.
