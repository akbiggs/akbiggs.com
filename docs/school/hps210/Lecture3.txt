Midterm Tips
==============

If you find common themes or topics between the book and the class slides,
there's a very good chance that it will be on the midterm. The main thing you
should know from the book are the themes that are discussed on each topic.

Part 1 of the Assignment
=========================

Worth a very small percentage of the assignment mark(10%).
He seems to be emphasizing sites that have few citations, even if they have some
content populated already.
Email to hps210h1@utoronto.ca with topic Assignment 1.

You're not doing a rewrite of the page, you are adding 500-1000 words.
Probably easier to pick a person, place or thing because it's easy to search
for.

Include the url for the copy-pasted content.

Sources for Research:
    -- Google Scholar (scholar.google.com)
        Typically search for stuff that's more recent, it'll usually be more
        interesting. However, it will only give likely sources, not access to
        them. So you find something that you want to source, then copy it into
        the U of T library search engine.
    -- University of Toronto Libraries site (supplement with Google Scholar)
        If something shows up in the search engine, it's considered a scholarly
        source and is fair game for the assignment.

Don't handcode references to resources, simply copy the Cite from Google
Scholar.

Go to Robarts for historical context, Gerrstein is great for research with some
historical context.

Teacher recommends just clicking around on Wikipedia until you find one that's
interesting and that has room for expansion.

Lecture 3
Classical Greek Science
============

Typically understood to be the starting point of science.
Starts around 600 BCE, 500 BCE with the rise of the Archaemenid Empire. When
they started trying to take things over, Greece began thinking of itself as a
unity as opposed to a bunch of separate entities.

They're pretty rich at this point and they are very much based on the water.
They draw in ideas from all around them. People would travel around the
Mediterranean and would bring back cultures into Greece.

Classical Greece (500 BCE - 300 BCE)
================
================

Parmenides (born 515 BCE?): "There is no such thing as nothing, or non-existence
can't exist". This means that nothing changes, and there is no difference
between anything and anything else, since it would mean that something would
have properties that do not exist elsewhere. Also he figured out somehow that
the universe is a sphere.

One contrast between Greece and China's way of thinkings is that paradoxes were
highly important in Chinese thinking and were considered a limitation of
language, whereas Greece attempted to solve all of the existing paradoxes.

Zeno's Paradoxes
==================

First paradox is: Since you cover half the distance progressively between
yourself and another object when running, you will never reach the other object
(half keeps getting smaller but never reaches zero).

Plato (428 - 348 BCE)
=====================

Deeply influenced by Parmenides in way of thinking.  Came up with the fable of
the cave: four men are shackled to a wall, and only see shadows, so shadows
become their world (illusion, false beliefs). Then one man is unshackled, and
reaches the outside world (representing pure rationality).

This represents Plato's world view -- we need to break through the shadows of
disillusion and come to the light of the truth.
Teacher believes this mindset did a huge disservice to science, lasting as a
worldview for 1500 years. Advocates that we won't gain much from messing around
with material stuff, since it's all an illusion. Aristotle saved us from this.

Plato believed that we were all the organs of this giant living thing that was
the universe.

Democritus (460 - 370 BCE)
==================

Student of Leucippus (5th century BCE).
Had a more sensible approach to Parmenidis: he believed that maybe there was a
smallest base unit (the atom) that definitely existed and that they bounced off
of each other and interacted. Democritus believed that nothing existed, but that
nothing could not be created, it simply gets displaced.

Empedocles (490 - 430 BCE)
=========================

Believed that people are reincarnated. His main contribution was to produce a
picture of the world through the four elements (fire, air, earth, water), which
share four properties (fire and air are hot, fire and earth are dry, earth and
water are cold, air and water are wet). THIS IS IMPORTANT, REPRODUCE DIAMOND
DIAGRAM! This would have been consulted by doctors to figure out how to treat
patients.

He believes that the universe is in-between two states: one of perfect form
(everything is spherical) and one of strife (everything is separated apart,
non-spherical states).

Applied all over the place: medicine, cosmology, metallurgy, ...

Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE)
=====================

Contributed three main ideas that are crucial to the narrative of this class:
    
    Logic: Syllogism. Creates a fairly nuanced logical system for proving things
    that exist. His arguments are kind-based, in that he associates each object
    or idea mentioned in an argument with a kind (a variable: X, Y, ...). His
    arguments are based on the characteristics that make up an object at the
    base level.

    Four Causes: For Aristotle, understanding the world involves invoking four
    explanations to explain every interaction between objects.
        
        Efficient: physical pushes and pulling. Believed to not be sufficient,
        adding in three more causes.

        Material: "statue is bronze". The material that constructs an object.

        Formal: The form of an idea brought into reality. E.g. a painter
        envisions Aristotle and brings that form into reality. Or when someone
        is born, something is maintaining the form of the living things, since
        if you cut off both hands off a woman and she gives birth, the child
        still has hands.

        Final: The purpose of an object, why it needs to exist. The purpose of a
        human being is to be a rational animal, and that is what drives us
        forward. The purpose of the Earth is to go down, explaining why we are
        pulled down when we jump.

    This is a radically different picture from our modern world. Aristotle wants
    to know why forces exist, why they are there, whereas in modern times we
    don't really care about the purpose of forces, we just know that they exist
    and have theories to explain them.

    Physics: His picture of how the universe is shaped was spherical. The Earth
    is located at the center, surrounded by layers of water, air, and fire,
    considered the sublunarary realm. Everything below the moon was the world of
    the four elements. He establishes a fifth element called quitessence (or
    ether), which was a material for everything located past the moon. All the
    materials want to go down, but stop when they are located over their
    corresponding material.

    He believes there are two types of motion in the world: natural motion and
    violent motion. Violent motion stems from interacting with things in an
    "unnatural" way, by shoving or pulling on it. If you want to understand the
    way something works, you have to let it work naturally, in its own
    environment. He also believes that there is a prime mover, an active
    intellect that started the interactions going and created the world but now
    spends all of its time rationalizing.

    The fifth element has a different natural motion: circular. The planets from
    the moon beyond and the sun all like to move in circles. As a result math
    would only apply beyond the moon, and everything below the moon was a mess
    that could only be figured out through observance of the different kinds and
    their interaction. 

Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE)
=====================

Probably a real person, but we can't distinguish his work from those around him
(fake Hippocrates). He was considered the legendary founder of Western medicine.

His main contribution was to figure out that disease and medicine was natural as
opposed to an omen from the gods, by way of observing the geometry of the places
of sick people.

Four Humours Theory: Compose the body. Each is made from an element. Too much of
one element unbalances you and you become sick.
  - Yellow bile (fire) = Choleric (angry)
  - Black bile (earth) = Melancholic (sad, irritable)
  - Phlegm (water) = sanguine (pleasure-seeking, sociable)
  - Blood (air) = phlegmatic (calm, unemotional)
MEMORIZE THIS FOR THE TEST

Hippocrates' main medical intervention was diet. Diet included exercise, food
that you eat, other regular stuff, but it also included the city that you live
in, the environment.

There are two classes of doctors in society: the rich doctors and the non-rich
doctors (women, people of different wealth). Rich doctors are very philosophical
and focus on research whereas non-rich doctors are doing...something else that
we don't know much about because there's no writing.

Also (maybe) created the Hippocratic Oath: a document that new doctors need to
swear to.

Alexandrian Science
===============

Philip and Alexander of Macedon
----------------------

Alexander (356 - 323 BCE) and his father conquered a lot of land and are
responsible for the spread of Hellenistic culture.

When he found the Library of Ashurbanipal, he wanted a similar library that
brings together the learning and culture of his society into one place(multiple
places, but in particular the Library of Alexandria).

The Library of Alexandria
---------------------

Founded by the Ptolemaic dynasty (people who run the Egyptian part of the
empire). Part of the larger Museum of Alexandria, dedicated to the Muses. If
anyone brought a book into Alexandria, a copy had to be made for the collection
of the library. This allowed Alexandria to accumulate a vast amount of
knowledge.

Part of the motivation behind setting up this library was to establish Alexander
as the rightful ruler of all the land through his cultural relevancy.
 
Euclid
---------

Employed at the library of Alexandria. He systemized Geometry through axioms
that established the laws of how geometry should function, although he didn't
bring many new geometrical features.

Eratosthenes (276 - 194 BCE)
-------------

A polymath who was also employed at the library. Estimated the size of the Earth
through the use of measuring the angle and distance of parallel rays of sunlight
and basic application of Geometry. Note that this only works if people believe
the Earth is round, not flat, so clearly we knew this for a long time.

Ptolemy (90 - 168 CE)
--------------

Easily the most famous astronomer in antiquity. His innovation was to take the
Aristotle view of the world and apply numbers to explaining the positions of the
stars and the planets in the sky. He was the author of the Almagest, a
collection of calculation tables for astronomy.

In order to make his calculations work, he had to make a few adjustments to the
model of the solar system. He had to add epicycles to the rotation of planets
that would explain why sometimes the stars and planets would appear to go
backwards. He also had to add an equant to the calculations, which was an offset
of the Earth from the center of the rotation.

One of the main things that motivated Copernicus to rework all of this is that
the equant doesn't make any sense physically with what Aristotle said. This
theory remains culturally relevant for a very long time and motivates a lot of
discussion and development.

Antikythera Mechanism (100 BCE)
-------------

A mechanism discovered recently that allowed people to determine when a lunar
eclipse would happen. This shows that the Babylonian techniques were transformed
into concrete methods of determing planetary positions through instruments used
by the Greeks.
