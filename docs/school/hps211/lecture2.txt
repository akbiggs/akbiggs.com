Lecture 2
Revolution
============

What represents a revolution?
The main thing is that there is a shift from one extreme to another.

The word revolution is tossed around all the time. It's seen everywhere.
The main reason is because people want to be part of revolutions. They want to
be part of change in society, because it makes them feel important.

There are 16 scientists apparently who have claimed directly that they are the
cause of a revolution. This includes James Watson, Einstein, Mandelbrot.

Where Does "Revolution" Come From?
----------

Newton(laws of motion) and Lavoisier(discovery of oxygen) were described as
revolutionary. First used to describe an extreme amount of motion.

The Scientific Revolution
-------------------------

Replacing pure reason being the basis of science with empiricism. All about
investigation and experimentation.

Structure and Revolution
------------------------

Name of the course comes from Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions
(1962), largely responsible for HPS as a discipline.

Largely influential. Basically coined the term 'paradigm' for ways of going
about science or any other particular discipline. Since the book was published,
the words 'scientific revolution' and 'paradigm' increased heavily.

The laws that people such as Newton have created are not necessarily valid in
all situations. Kuhn questions how science progresses, how mindsets change. He
proposes that science doesn't change in the way we think it does. The pattern he
proposes is a Kuhnian Revolution, where scientists most the time are solving
puzzles, clarifying things that are unclear. They have a hypothesis, and
experiment and they try to verify. Either the hypothesis succeeds, in which case
you build upon it, or the hypothesis fails, in which case they tinker with it to
create a new paradigm.

Kuhn calls things that don't fit within a paradigm *anomalies*. They don't throw
away hypotheses based on single anomalies, but when they build up scientists
tend towards making a new theory that encompasses the anomalies. At this point
the old paradigm enters a phase of crisis and new paradigms begin to spring up.
After this competition, a new paradigm is established and codified.

There's an interesting consequence to this. There is a problem that Kuhn calls
"incommencerability", where the old and new paradigm are unable to coexist and
communicate. The words used between the paradigms are the same but with
different meanings. We don't necessarily make progress, we switch to new
definitions, leaving the old behind. This is the essence of a revolution.

Industrial Revolution
1760 - 1840 (memorize)
=======================

Great Britain, Western Europe to the United States.
A drastic change technologically, socially and economically.

Factories, machines and tools powered by new kinds of steam engines and rivers
are the symbol of the revolution. People from mainly agricultural backgrounds
begin moving to cities. Skilled laborers aren't needed to make fabrics anymore,
so they move to the city to get more jobs, and producing things becomes much
more cheap.

The revolution is fueled by iron and coal.
Combination of regular and steam-powered ships. Steam becomes a method of
transportation. You have people moving all over the place, via railroads, which
are expanding dramatically during the mid-1800s.

Because the jobs have been replaced by machines, you no longer need skilled
laborers to do jobs. Creates a lot of jobs for out of work men, women and
children. This allows for some social mobility between the classes, but there's
generally a dispute about whether or not this was a prosperous time. The average
life has changed, but maybe it has not improved, since people are working in
factories and paying it back.

Treaty between France and America
----------------------------------

France and America were sinking each others' ships over a deal gone wrong for a
lot of money, treaty stops that. The consequence of this is that more things are
getting sold, products can move between countries and people can travel.
Supposedly this is a revolutionary change.

March 20 1800 - Alessandro Volta describes his new invention, the voltaic pile,
the first chemical battery, in a letter to the Royal Society of London. Sets the
stage for many scientific changes.

Geology in the 18th and 19th Centuries
========================================

Without much knowledge of the Earth, it's very difficult to figure out where
things come from. We reached to theories to explain how organisms adapted and
changed over time when trying to sort fossils in class, but back then there was
no theory.

Fossils become very important all of a sudden in the 18th and 19th centuries,
because people are mining for coal. They are digging down into the ground, and
they discover fossils.

Dynamite is invented mid to late 1800s. People are blowing stuff up, using
gunpowder before dynamite. The mining industry becomes very interested in this.
They are draining water from deposits, and as they continue digging they find
things they don't expect. The fossils began to be used to figure out where the
resources were located, because this would lead to earning more money.

This changes the way that people begin to think about religion (specifically
Christianity). If the world is only 7000 years old, why is there all this stuff
from ages ago? Why would God create animals and just whisk them away?

They use types of rocks to date what things came out of stuff. This doesn't
really work, and fossils work much more effectively for dating. Someone (who?
Kouvier?) came up with a system for examining invertebrae fossils and comparing
them to things that exist in modern day times.

People are questioning how different types of rocks get into fields with nothing
but a particular type of rock, and how fossils of sea creatures get into
mountains. Kouvier doesn't make connections between religion and the fossils
being discovered, but Buckland comes up with Noah's flood.

The transition between layers were small, so they believe that transitions
happened fast. They know that earthquakes used to be bigger before, and they
believe this is because the Earth was cooled.

Principles of Geology (The End of Catastrophism)
================================================

Eventually catastrophism is challenged. by Charles Lyell, reviving the ideas of
a man named Hutton from the late 1700s. He says that there are no catastrophies,
no dramatic changes, and that everything we see is just the result of small
changes. This means that the world has to be much, much older than people had
previously supposed. He says that things get reformed, each successive level
formed by the different changes that we observe now.

He takes this a step further and says that animals do not get better over time,
there is no progress.

The cover of his book shows weathering on columns for a Greek temple, erosion.
High contrast between weathered and non-weathered parts, non-weathered parts
being protected by water from the nearby river. We know how old the ruins are,
which gives us an idea of how fast the processes work. Lyell says that if so
much can happen over 2000 years, much more can happen over a much longer period
of time.

Both were Diests, and reconciled their theories with God by saying that God set
the world up like a clock, and doesn't intervene, he just set things up in an
order, and that's how God works. This is not the view of Kouvier and Buckland,
they believed in progress and creation, although Buckland's view changes.

The uniformiarionists believed that there was no beginning to the world, which
is not something that we believe today. Catastrophes come back into favor when
the Earth is revealed not to be nearly as old as Lyell and Hutton believed.
There is no clear winner in this history.
