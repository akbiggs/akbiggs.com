CSC490 Lecture 3

Lawyer groups:

If you work as a lawyer in a company(in-house counsel), you are considered
a cost of that business, you are not creating value for the business(CEOs).
So you NEED to show that you're delivering value, and delivering it fast.

Small companies usually don't have an in-house lawyer, due to the cost.
You only get an in-house if you plan on needing the lawyer for more than
200 hours.

For certain typical tasks, you have more of a flat predictable fee. So
the lawyers care about being efficient here, e.g. in real estate.
